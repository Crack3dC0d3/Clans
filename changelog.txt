Additions:
Added a config option to set items that are forbidden during raids.
Added a new system to replace the opclan: limitless clans. These behave similarly to opclan, except they have members, and can be disbanded. Existing opclans will be converted into limitless clans.
New command: /opclan setlimitless <clan> <true|1|false|0>
New command: /opclan setrank <member|admin|leader> <clan> <player>
New command: /clan seechunk [on|off]

Changes:
/[clan|opclan|raid] help commands now have command usage and descriptions, are paginated, and sorted alphabetically. In addition, you can view help for specific subcommands.
Players can no longer use /raid collect while in the middle of a raid
Removed /opclan promote and /opclan demote (use /opclan setrank)
Syntax/behavior change: /opclan claim/autoclaim now have a <clan> argument, and always force claim for the target clan.
Syntax/behavior change: /opclan abandonclaim/autoabandon now take no arguments, and always force claim abandonment.
Syntax/behavior change: /opclan setcolor/setdescription/setname now have a <clan> argument to select which clan to set that data for.
/clan home now tells you how long the warmup is and cancels it if you move or are hurt during the warmup period

Fixes/Internal Changes:
Fixed /clan and /raid commands being unusable in console.
Major performance improvement to rent/upkeep checking logic
Fixed crash when player disconnects during a raid
Fixed exception when you don't include the sort for /clan list
