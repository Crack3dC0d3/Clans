Additions:
Added the clan option for if PVP is allowed: -1 is default behavior (protect clan members if they aren't being raided, or disable PVP for server clans). 0 is PVP disabled (also disables raids on that clan). 1 is all PVP allowed.

Changes:
PVP is now disabled on server clans' land by default
