Additions:
Internal preparations for Dynmap compatibility. The mod will still need a quick update to finish off Dynmap compat once Dynmap is updated to 1.13.2.
New command: /clan playerinfo - shows what clans a player is in and what rank they hold in each clan.
New command: /clan setcolor - sets the clan color for Dynmap, and the clan name in chat uses the closest chat color to this.
New command: /clan list - View the names and descriptions of all clans on the server.

Changes:
Improve chat colors - Wilderness is now yellow when protected, like other protected land.
The /clan map is now color coded: Green for clans the player is a member of, yellow for wilderness, red for clans the player is not part of, and blue for where the player is currently standing.
The clan home warmup time can now be set to -1 to disable /clan home.
Add the default clan before the player's name in chat
Show offline members in clan details, hide member count and "No members" message if looking at opclan details.
Show the clan's description when you enter its territory.
Improved the performance of database saving - it now occurs every 5 minutes, if needed, and when the server shuts down. This is a huge improvement over saving immediately when anything in the database changes.
Internal optimizations
Change the way clans are stored - the database is now json-based, so server owners can modify it if needed, and internal changes to clans and the clan database can be made easily without breaking the database. Databases from version 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 will be migrated to the new format.
The default minimum distance between clan homes is now 320 blocks, aka 20 chunks, aka reasonably out of sight with a 16 chunk (Far) render distance.
Minor performance improvement to saving and restoring block data from raids.
Minor improvement to clan claim feedback colors

Fixes:
Fix crash when player is not in a clan
Fixed a bug that caused a new opclan to be generated every time the server started.
Updated to work with Forge 25.0.168+
Improved cache reliability - less wonky things that get fixed by relogging or rebooting the server should occur.
Fixed server crash when player tries using /clan home and the clan doesn't have a home.
