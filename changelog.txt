Additions:
Added Dynmap integration - Dynmap now shows what land is claimed by which clans.
New command: /clan playerinfo - shows what clans a player is in and what rank they hold in each clan.
New command: /clan setcolor - sets the clan color for Dynmap, and the clan name in chat uses the closest chat color to this.
New command: /clan list - View the names and descriptions of all clans on the server.
New command: /clan fancymap - View a taller and differently color coded clan map.
New configs: initial claim separation multiplier, enforce initial claim separation, Dynmap border weight, Dynmap border opacity, and Dynmap fill opacity.
Added initial claim distance enforcement, to prevent clans from stacking up next to each other and being unable to grow or forced to see each others' bases.

Changes:
The player's default clan is now shown before the player's name in chat.
Show offline members in clan details, hide member count and "No members" message if looking at opclan details.
Show the clan's description when you enter its territory.
Improved chat colors - Wilderness is now yellow when protected, like other protected land.
The /clan map is now color coded: Green for clans the player is a member of, yellow for wilderness, red for clans the player is not part of, and blue for where the player is currently standing.
The clan home warmup time can now be set to -1 to disable /clan home.
It is now far easier to avoid accidentally making a clan's first claim within the minimum clan home distance of another clan's home. If not being enforced, the player is still shown a warning against claiming within that range before they are allowed to do it.
Merged the functionality of /raid form into /raid join. Use /raid join to create or join a raiding party.
The raid cost is now paid when /raid start is used, not /raid form.
/opclan claim can now be used to claim land for other clans
Many opclan commands can now be used from the console
/clan details can now be used from the console
Improved much of the command feedback (The improvements that came with 1.1.0 plus additional improvements)
Improved the performance of database saving - it now occurs every 5 minutes, if needed, and when the server shuts down. This is a huge improvement over saving immediately when anything in the database changes.
Improved cache reliability - less wonky things that get fixed by relogging or rebooting the server should occur.
Internal optimizations
Change the clan banner saving format to be more consistent with the 1.13 method. The clan banners might or might not migrate to 1.13 successfully now. Pre-1.2.0 clan banners will be lost, so make sure you have a physical banner available so you can set it again.
Change the way clans are stored - the database is now json-based, so server owners can modify it if needed, and internal changes to clans and the clan database can be made easily without breaking the database. Databases from version 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 will be migrated to the new format.
Additional feedback messages: You now get a confirmation message after successfully inviting a player to a clan, setting your default clan, and messages when various stages of a raid are reached.
The default minimum distance between clan homes is now 320 blocks, aka 20 chunks, aka reasonably out of sight with a 16 chunk (Far) render distance.
Greatly improved the performance of /clan map. Clans will need to abandon and reclaim their land for it to show up on the map.
Improved /clan home teleportation handling, you are far less likely to run into issues with the clan home being falsely obstructed
Minor performance improvement to saving and restoring block data from raids.
Minor performance improvement to tab completions for the opclan disband command.

Fixes:
Fixed server crash when player tries using /clan home and the clan doesn't have a home.
Fixed long lines of chat losing color when going to the second line
Fixed a minor performance issue that occurred after the server has been running for over 60 seconds
Fixed some errors in the console when autocompleting commands
Fixed a bug that caused a new opclan to be generated every time the server started.
Fixed wrong usage exception being thrown for /clan setdesc and /opclan setdesc
Fixed permission error when trying to accept a clan invite when already in a clan on multi clan membership servers
Fixed clan shield calculation when starting a raid
Fixed default clan not getting set when joining a clan
Fixed default clan check on login not updaging default clan when players are no longer in their previous default clan
Fixed multiple explosions messing up the chunk restoration
You can no longer form a raid against a clan you're in
