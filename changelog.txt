Additions:

Changes:
Raid Kill-Death Ratio has been replaced with Win-Loss ratio because it results in a better balanced game
The config option to enable stealing during raids also enables stealing from otherwise locked containers

Fixes/Internal Changes:
Greatly improved container checking, should prevent access to more mods' containers such as IC2
Additional container checks are now done for Storage Drawers drawers.
