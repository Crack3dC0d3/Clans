Additions:
Added a config option to allow disabling the clan home acting as a fallback spawnpoint for players without a bed

Changes:
Players who are dead and sitting on the respawn screen will now receive a chat message(instead of action bar notification) informing them if a raid is being prepared/starting
Players are now teleported out of the chunk before it gets restored, to help prevent them from suffocating in regenerated blocks
Updated zh_cn translation (mcqwy)

Fix the error when attempting to access a locked block which doesn't have any overrides set
Fixed the other half of a double chest not getting locked
Fixed /clan invite [invalidname] and /clan invite <send|revoke> [invalidname] not giving a proper error message
