Additions:
Added Dynmap integration - Dynmap now shows what land is claimed by which clans.
New command: /clan playerinfo - shows what clans a player is in and what rank they hold in each clan.
New command: /clan setcolor - sets the clan color for Dynmap, and the clan name in chat uses the closest chat color to this.
New command: /clan list - View the names and descriptions of all clans on the server.

Changes:
The player's default clan is now shown before the player's name in chat.
Show offline members in clan details, hide member count and "No members" message if looking at opclan details.
Show the clan's description when you enter its territory.
Improved chat colors - Wilderness is now yellow when protected, like other protected land.
The /clan map is now color coded: Green for clans the player is a member of, yellow for wilderness, red for clans the player is not part of, and blue for where the player is currently standing.
Improve a few feedback messages
Improved the performance of database saving - it now occurs every 5 minutes, if needed, and when the server shuts down. This is a huge improvement over saving immediately when anything in the database changes.
Improved cache reliability - less wonky things that get fixed by relogging or rebooting the server should occur.
Internal optimizations
Change the clan banner saving format to be more consistent with the 1.13 method. The clan banners might or might not migrate to 1.13 successfully now. Pre-1.2.0 clan banners will be lost, so make sure you have a physical banner available so you can set it again.
Change the way clans are stored - the database is now json-based, so server owners can modify it if needed, and internal changes to clans and the clan database can be made easily without breaking the database. Databases from version 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 will be migrated to the new format.

Fixes:
Fixed server crash when player tries using /clan home and the clan doesn't have a home.
Fixed long lines of chat losing color when going to the second line
Fixed a minor performance issue that occurred after the server has been running for over 60 seconds
Fixed some errors in the console when autocompleting commands
Fixed a bug that caused a new opclan to be generated every time the server started.
