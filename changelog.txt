Fixed server crash when player tries using /clan home and the clan doesn't have a home.
Internal optimizations
Improved cache reliability - less wonky things that get fixed by relogging or rebooting the server should occur.
Fix long lines of chat losing color when going to the second line
Improve chat colors - Wilderness is now yellow when protected, like other protected land.
Improve a few messages
Add the default clan before the player's name in chat
Add a new command: /clan playerinfo - shows what clans a player is in and what ranks they hold in the clan.
Added Dynmap integration - Dynmap now shows what land is claimed by which clans.
Fixed a minor performance issue that occurred after the server has been running for over 60 seconds
