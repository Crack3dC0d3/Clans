Added configs:
Warmup period at the start of raids, so defenders get a chance to prepare.
Make defenders glow when the end of the raid is approaching, to prevent them from hiding to run out the clock.
Force clans to have connected claims, to prevent defenders from hiding and running out the clock.
Limit a clan's maximum claims based on the number of players in the clan.
Be a member of multiple clans at once.
Set a warmup and/or cooldown for /clan home

Added commands:
/clan trapped - teleport out of another clan's territory, or back to spawn if trapped in the Wilderness.
/clan setdefault - set which clan to default to when using /clan commands without specifying the clan name. See details below.
/opclan promote/demote/kick/disband/addfunds - ways for admins to modify other clans
/opclan buildadmin - allows ops to toggle on and off the ability to place/break/interact with blocks in any claim

Changes and fixes:
Because players are now able to be members of multiple clans, all /clan commands, as well as /opclan setname and setdescription, allow you to insert a clan name between the command name (clan/opclan) and the subcommand you are using. If one is not included, your default clan will be used. You can set your default clan at any time with /clan setdefault. The default for opclan commands is opclan.
All commands now support using tab autocomplete
Fixed an error when using /opclan abandonclaim
Players can now be promoted/demoted/kicked when they are offline
