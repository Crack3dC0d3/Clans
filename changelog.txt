Updated to 1.13.2
Merged the functionality of /raid form into /raid join. Use /raid join to create or join a raiding party.
The raid cost is now paid when /raid start is used, not /raid form.
Improved much of the command feedback
/clan form now has an alias: /clan create
/opclan claim can now be used to claim land for other clans
Most opclan commands(addfunds, promote, demote, kick, disband, setname, setdescription, setshield) can now be run from the console
